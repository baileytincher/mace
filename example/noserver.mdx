### Without Server

`mace` can work without a backend server.
Without a server contents are saved to `localStorage`.

The following two editors are synchronized using only `localStorage`.
Control-s will trigger a save.
The reset button will return the editor to the original content provided by the page.

```java play id=noserver
System.out.println("Hello, world!");
```

```java play id=noserver
System.out.println("Hello, world!");
```
