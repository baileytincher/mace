### With Server

<LoginButton />

With a server contents are saved both to `localStorage` and on the `mace` server.
Integration with Google client-side login is also included.
If the user is logged in, saved contents are identified by their email address, and so available across tabs and browsers.

The following two editors are synchronized.
Control-s will trigger a save.
The reset button will return the editor to the original content provided by the page.

```java play id=withserver
System.out.println("Hello, world!");
```

```java play id=withserver
System.out.println("Hello, world!");
```
