## Use

Visit the documentation [here](https://github.com/cs125-illinois/mace/).

First, wrap your app in the `<MaceProvider />` component, configured to point at your server (if you are using one):

```jsx
const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <MaceProvider server={yourMaceServer} googleToken={yourGoogleToken}>
      <RestOfYourApp />
    </MaceProvider>
  )
}
```

Inside the `<MaceProvider />` you can use the `<MaceEditor />` component as a drop-in replacement for the `<AceEditor />` component provided by `react-ace`.
The only difference is that you need to provide an `id` prop uniquely identifying each editor instance.
Generating those IDs is up to you.
One way is to generate unique IDs such as UUIDs and save them with the page contents.
Another approach is to generate a unique ID that is a combination of the initial editor contents and its position on the page.
